       "'FIM Sections relating to Limit Review  B.20.2.1 General Principles Policy Approval and delegation of market risk limits.  Risk Type Primary: Market Secondary:  Purpose General principles of market risk limits.  Application The level of market risk limits set for each operation depends upon: the size and financial and capital resources of the business, the business plan, the experience and track record of the management and dealers, internal audit gradings from Group Financial Services Audit (GHQ AUF), support function resources and computer systems.  Market Risk limits should be sufficiently granular and of a level to ensure that large and significant concentrations to sectors, risk factors and counterparties are not allowed to build up that could threaten the ongoing operations of HSBC Group.  Throughout Section B.20 limits refers to the limit mandate which where applicable also includes the permitted instrument list.  See Appendix D20.2.1 for definition of Major Limits, Minor Limits and Thresholds.   B.20.2.2 Review of Group Limits Policy Market risk limits must be reviewed annually.  Risk Type Primary: Market  Secondary:  Purpose To establish formal market risk limits annually for each site within Group caps.  Application The Annual Limit Review (ALR) will be prepared by Group Risk WMR and reviewed by the Risk Management Meeting (RMM) of the Group Management Board (GMB) each year.  \\xa0 Each site should submit a request annually to apply for market risk limits covering the following calendar year. All requests should be submitted to\\xa0Group Risk WMR in writing. Requests should clearly indicate the support of the relevant CEO, Principal Office Manager or delegate and, where applicable, the local and/or regional Head of Global Markets and the Regional Head of Traded Risk. All annual submissions must contain, without exception, formal confirmation that all limits can be independently monitored and that all products have passed through an appropriate due diligence process.  \\xa0 The RMM have delegated limit approval authority to\\xa0Group Risk WMR up to pre-agreed Group caps. These caps are reviewed annually by the RMM as part of the ALR.\\xa0 \\xa0 Group Risk WMR submits material interim limit additions, amendments and excesses to RMM each month.  See Appendix D.20.2.2 for details of the Annual Limit Review.    B.20.2.3 Delegation of Limits Policy Limits must be formally delegated.  Risk Type Primary: Market  Secondary:  Purpose To ensure senior management approval and delegated accountability.  Application The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or management equivalent of each Group company or division will seek the approval of the relevant Board or equivalent as appropriate. Once these have been approved by Group Risk WMR and the regional RMC, subject to RMM ratification, the regional entity mandates are delegated to the Regional Heads of Global Markets. Further delegation is done until at least Desk level mandates. \\xa0 It is expected that the bulk of the limits will be delegated to the Heads of Global Markets, however a portion of some or all of the limits may be withheld to allow flexibility for unusual market opportunities. For further detail as to how the process works in each region see Appendix D.20.2.3.    B.20.2.4 Interim Amendment of Limits Policy Interim amendment of limits requires the approval of Group Risk, WMR  Risk Type Primary: Market  Secondary:  Purpose To ensure senior management support, completion of due diligence where appropriate and Group Risk WMR approval of limit amendments.  Application These will occur from time to time.\\xa0It is expected that businesses will endeavour to anticipate their immediate and future market risk limit requirements when submitting limits for annual review. However, the need for interim amendments may arise but these can only be utilised after formal approval or recommendation for approval has been obtained from\\xa0Group Risk, WMR.\\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0 All requests for limits should have the support of senior management of the site and/or the region and requests must be able to be independently monitored and have been through an appropriate due diligence as necessary. \\xa0 \"One-off\" transaction proposals which require limit amendments may be submitted but must also have been through a sufficient due diligence process and carry senior management support prior to submission to\\xa0Group Risk, WMR.  See Appendix D.20.2.4 for detailed description of the Limit Change Process.     B.20.2.5 Exceptional Review Policy In exceptional circumstances Group Risk WMR may give instruction for limits to be reduced.  Risk Type Primary: Market  Secondary:  Purpose To retain risk within the Group\\'s appetite.  Application Group Risk WMR may give instruction to reduce any position or limit in exceptional circumstances.    B.20.3.1 Compliance with Market Risk Limits Policy The Head of Front Office of each unit is responsible for ensuring that limits are complied with.  Risk Type Primary: Market  Secondary:  Purpose To define responsibility and accountability.  Application The Head of Front Office of each unit is responsible for ensuring that limits are complied with.    B.20.3.2 Monitoring of Market Risk Limits Policy Utilisation against overnight limits will be independently monitored on a daily basis.  Risk Type Primary: Market  Secondary:  Purpose To ensure risk positions are managed within approved limits.  Application Utilisation against overnight limits will be monitored by an independent limits monitoring team on a daily basis.\\xa0All new or amended limits should be monitored from the date of\\xa0Group Risk WMR / local approval. Limits must be promptly loaded to the appropriate limit monitoring system.  \\xa0 If any\\xa0sub-limits of the\\xa0Group Risk WMR limits, are set locally by Traded Risk, then they\\xa0should also be independently monitored on a daily basis. Excesses at this level should only be reported to local management.  Utilisation of intra-day limits cannot be verified independently since reported utilisation depends upon the speed and order of input to computer systems. The responsibility for complying with limits intra-day rests with the Desk Head and the ultimate responsibility with the Head of Front Office. Where system constraints exist it is understood that intraday risk limits cannot be monitored. However, front office personnel and Traded Risk management should have an understanding of the effect that new trades will have on risks and consider the impact of new positions in relation to any limits. It is Front Office responsibility to ensure that utilisations meet end of day limits. Where intraday trading / hedging activity creates the likelihood that end of day risk limits will be breached, it is Front Office responsibility to inform Traded Risk management, agree remedial action and date by which remediation must take place.  \\xa0 To assist in the annual limit review (Section B.20.2.2) a history of daily utilisations of the major limits must be kept.    B.20.3.3 Pre-Approval of Excesses Over Market Risk Limits Policy Anticipated excesses over market risk limits require the pre-approval of Group Risk, WMR.  Risk Type Primary: Market  Secondary:  Purpose To ensure risks taken are within the Group\\'s appetite.  Application Where it is anticipated that there may be an excess over a (entity mandate) market risk limit, approval must be sought from\\xa0Group Risk WMR by either the Head of Front Office or local Traded Risk manager in terms of either a temporary or permanent limit extension (note Group Risk WMR approval is not required for desk level limits). \\xa0 Details of the size of the excess, potential duration and reason for the excess will be required before approval is recommended.    B.20.3.4 Excesses Over Market Risk Limits Policy Excesses must be explained by the Head of Front Office to the Principal Office Manager, and Group Risk WMR notified on the same business day.  Risk Type Primary: Market  Secondary:  Purpose To monitor and escalate as necessary excesses over approved limits.  Application These should only arise in exceptional circumstances.  \\xa0 Excesses must generally be reported to one level of management above the owner of the limit that has been breached and reported to Group Risk WMR (for entity mandate excesses) using the Limit Breach Escalation template in Markets FIM D.20.3.4.1. However for the escalation process for each level of limit breach see Appendix D.20.3.4.  \\xa0 Note 1: Excesses to Stop Loss Limits at a Desk level must be advised to the Head of Desk, Head of Front Office, Head of Regional Traded Risk Management and Group Risk WMR on the following business day in the report format set out in Appendix D.20.3.4.\\xa0 Evidence of follow up actions is required.    B.20.3.5 Summary Report of Significant Limit Excesses and Limit Amendments Policy Regions should ensure that a summary of significant market risk limit excesses and market risk limit amendments, together with appropriate explanations, are submitted to the appropriate RMC or ALCO (where RMC has not been constituted). The information must be sent on a monthly basis.  Risk Type Primary: Market  Secondary:  Purpose To ensure senior management are aware of significant limit excesses and amendments.  Application Regions should ensure that a summary of significant market risk limit excesses and market risk limit amendments, together with appropriate explanations, are submitted to their local RMC or local ALCO (where\\xa0RMC is not constituted)\\xa0for information on a monthly basis. Regional subsidiary head offices should include material changes for all their sites in this submission to the regional RMC or regional ALCO (where no regional RMC has not been constituted).                    D.20.2.1 DEFINITION OF MAJOR LIMITS, MINOR LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS All limit breaches are reportable and will be taken into account when reviewing trader behaviour and used in the year end evaluation process. Traded Risk has apportioned these limits for governance and control purposes. However, it should not be assumed that any limit is more/less important than another one.  Major Limits: These are agreed regionally by each Regional Head of Traded Risk, and are tailored to the specific risk profiles of the regional businesses activity. Major limits generally comprise those desk limits that ensure that the overall risk at Site and Consolidated Entity level is within the risk appetite limits set by Group- and Regional WMR. These may include, but are not limited to: - Desk level Sub-allocations of the site level market risk limits are used to contain the risk exposures of the trading desk such that the combined activity is in accordance with the risk appetite of the bank at Site and Entity level. They will include, but are not limited to: - Any of the metrics capped at the Group or overall Global Markets levels - Stop Losses at the Site level exceeding the limit by the lower of 50% or USD5m - The desk level permitted instrument lists - Referrals: a particular type of limit set around factors which may be beyond the power of the traders to control. Breaches of stop-loss referrals must be escalated as per FIM B.20.3.4. - Volcker Limits: All desk level limits deemed to be \\x91Volcker\\x92 Limits under the various Volcker exemptions are classed as Major limits for that desk and escalated accordingly.  Minor Limits: Any limits not defined as Major Limits are termed Minor limits. Effective risk management requires a more granular set of controls than are defined by the Major limits, so when designing the mandate for each business and/or desk, the Traded Risk defines more refined limits around the risk factors specific to that desk. These Traded Risk defined limits ensure that the risk exposure is managed at an appropriately granular level (e.g. to enable Traded Risk managers to restrict large offsetting IR exposures at individual tenor points/buckets, which would not be apparent from looking at the outright IR exposure). They also alert Traded Risk to unusual or unexpected activity, or allow Traded Risk to constrain specific activities to de minimis levels as required.  Minor limits are designed to ensure that the desk/site is operating within all intended parameters and are set out in each trading mandate. They are typically calibrated against \\x93Business as Usual\\x94 activity.   From a desk perspective, both Major and Minor limits must be treated in accordance with FIM C.11.5, with Traded Risk requiring to be informed prior to any situation that could lead to an excess, and a temporary increase agreed in advance.  Thresholds: Thresholds may be set around any risk factor that the risk manager is interested in triggering if exposure exceeds a certain level. They are often set as a percentage of an existing limit, or to monitor sub-allocations of a desk (where the hard limits are set at desk level). Thresholds are for information purposes only, however a large number of trigger breaches may still warrant escalation if the risk manager has concerns, particularly if the number is outside the normal levels of other desks or has increased over time.  Review of Limit Categories The limit categories should be reviewed on an annual basis by Traded Risk and signed off by the Regional Head of Traded Risk. Justification should be given for all Major Referral, Minor and Threshold limits. Evidence of the review should be saved as per the record retention policy.   Suggested Justifications: (Minor limits) - Limit not set at Entity (or equivalent) level - Portfolio/Strategy: Limit is monitored as Major Limit at desk level  Suggested Justifications: (Thresholds) - Portfolio/Strategy: Limit is monitored as Minor Limit at desk level. - Threshold set as % of mandate limit  The limit category of each limit must be clearly marked on the mandate, e.g. by a colour-coding system. This is to ensure that all parties are aware of the limit category for each limit.  The limit category of each limit should also be recorded in any limit monitoring system. This is to ensure that the correct escalation is applied in the event of a breach, and the category should be included in any reconciliations between the system and the mandates (where required).    D.20.2.2 REVIEW OF LIMITS D.20.2.2.1 ANNUAL LIMIT REVIEW (ALR) The Annual Limit Review (ALR) is prepared by Group Risk WMR and reviewed by the Risk Management Meeting (RMM) of the Group Management Board (GMB) each year. ALCO books are additionally approved by the relevant local ALCO and Group ALCM.  All entity requests should be submitted to\\xa0Group Risk WMR in writing. Requests should clearly indicate the support of the relevant CEO, Principal Office Manager or delegate and, where applicable, the local and/or regional Head of Global Markets (or equivalent) and the regional Head of Traded Risk. All annual submissions must contain, without exception, formal confirmation that all limits can be independently monitored and that all products have passed through an appropriate due diligence process.    The level of market risk limits set for each operation depends upon: the size and financial and capital resources of the business, the business plan, calibration for customer demand (ie RENTD calibration under Volcker), the market liquidity, the experience and track record of the management and dealers, Internal Audit grading from Group Financial Services Audit, support function resources and computer systems.  The Traded Risk management units within the regions are responsible for co-ordinating the submission of market and credit risk limit proposals on behalf of all Global Markets operations. Limit applications are submitted in accordance with Markets FIM Section B.20 and B.30 unless otherwise agreed with Group Risk WMR. Where the scope of limits required varies from that in place for the previous year, Group Risk WMR will advise under separate cover. Dispensations from the requirement to set limits should be formally requested as part of the Markets FIM dispensation process via the Group Manuals System.  Traded Risk are required to explicitly confirm the all the limits proposed in the submissions are independently monitored daily on an end-of-day basis (or as appropriate in accordance with Markets FIM) and that due diligence has been completed for all permitted products.  As part of the scope for the review, and for ongoing interim limit amendments, where branches or subsidiaries are covered within a major entity mandate, any legal, regulatory or local procedural requirements should be considered in addition to any capital implications when allocating limits to, or from, the sites within that major entity mandate.  It is a mandatory requirement for all submissions to incorporate a comprehensive strategy paper (using the Group Risk WMR approved template) for each Volcker trading desk.  This should be submitted as part of the supporting documentation together with a copy of the AOP and any further market data information that may assist with the approval process for the existing limit structure and any new business initiative.  The paper should incorporate any information as appropriate to the business requirements.  Limit recommendations will not be approved without a comprehensive strategy paper.   Approval Process: - Timetable set by Group Risk WMR - Regional Traded Risk sends requests to sites for submissions.  Requests should clearly indicate the necessity for confirmation of support from the relevant CEO, CFO and Principal Office Manager or delegate, together with utilisation figures, audit results and AOP.   - Regional Traded Risk complete reviews (usually by early October), including documenting rationale for changes. - Obtain support from regional Head of Global Markets for all Entities. - Initial discussions held with Group Risk WMR. - Entity level proposals are submitted to Group Risk WMR (usually at end of October). - Following Group Risk WMR approval, submit a copy of entity limits for approval to regional GBM Traded Risk RMC. - Once recommended for approval by Group Risk WMR, limits will be subject to ratification of the RMM (normally in February each year). - The procedures relating to the delegation of risk limits are documented in the Markets FIM Section 20.2.3.  Essentially, once limits have been approved, subject to RMM ratification of the Group/entity limits, the regional entity mandate is delegated to the regional Treasurer.  Further delegation of the site/branch mandates is issued to the Branch Treasury Manager by the regional Head of Global Markets, and copied to the local CEO.  These limits are in turn passed onto the Desk Managers by the regional Treasurer and Branch Treasury Manager.   - Regional Traded Risk administers the process of issuing/renewing all trading authorities on an annual basis.   Trading Desks: - Regional Traded review and discuss limit requirements with Head of Desk. - Head of the Desk prepares and submits the strategy paper. - All limit changes as proposed by asset class Traded Risk or recommended by the head of  the business line should be discussed with the Traded Risk lead for the relevant asset class - Meetings held with asset class Traded Risk lead and regional Head of Traded Risk for approval. - All recommendations consolidated into regional mandate. - Utilisation at regional entity level obtained from Traded Risk Control for high level/summary asset class limits.   D.20.2.2.2 QUARTERLY LIMIT REVIEW At the end of each quarter, there is a review of limit utilisations and where these are low, in consultation with the business, regional Traded Risk should suggest reductions to Group Risk WMR. It is also expected that desks will recalibrate their RENTD calculations quarterly where appropriate, and hence there may be a need to recalibrate the desk Volcker limits quarterly as well. Note desks will need to document the rationale for any changes to limits and Traded Risk will be required to review these rationales. The approvals for these limit changes should be in line with the standard procedure for any limit change.   D.20.2.2.3 REVIEW OF DESK STRATEGY PAPERS Traded Risk are required to complete certain sections of the Desk Strategy Papers that relate to the market risk limits (currently sections 3.3.1, 4.1, 4.4 of v1.5 of the Market Making strategy template), and also to review those sections that relate to the trading and hedging strategies employed by the desk as well as those relating to the desk limits. This review is required as a minimum of annually (when the Annual Limit Review is completed) and when updates are made to the Desk Strategy Papers (this includes where the updates to any section are made).  The Desk Strategy Paper includes the desk limit mandate and the permitted instrument list (and for Desks using the RMH exemption under Volcker, . Both of these are subject to the Annual Limit Review.  It should be noted that desks that make use of the Trading on Behalf of Customers (\\x91ToBoC\\x92) the permitted instrument lists cannot contain derivative instruments.  There needs to be control over the review process including documentation of who and when each review was undertaken.   D.20.2.2.4 PERMITTED INSTRUMENT LISTS The Desk Strategy Paper includes the limit mandate which also includes the permitted instrument list. This needs to be reviewed annually as well. Permitted instruments are only allowed to be added to a desks permitted instrument list once the instrument has passed through the appropriate due diligence process.  It should be noted that for desks that make use of the Trading on Behalf of Customers (\\x91ToBoC\\x92) exemption under Volcker, the permitted instrument lists cannot contain derivative instruments.  Any breach of the Permitted Instrument lists is deemed to be a Major limit breach and escalated as per D.20.3.4. This includes restrictions on an instrument such as a tenor breach.    D.20.2.3 Delegation of Limits by Region Europe / Middle East The procedures relating to the delegation of risk limits are documented in the Markets FIM Section 20.2.3.  Essentially, once the limits have been approved by Group Risk WMR and the regional RMC, subject to RMM ratification of the Group/Entity limits, the regional entity mandates are delegated to the Regional Head of Global Markets.  Further delegation of the site/branch level mandates are issued to the Local Head of Global Markets by the Regional Head of Global Markets, and copied to the local CEO.  These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Local Head of Global Markets as appropriate.  Asia Once the limits have been approved by HBAP RMC, they go to the regional CEO of HBAP and CEO for Hong Kong for further delegation. These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Regional Head of Global Markets as appropriate.  North America Once the entity limits have been approved by the regional RMC or equivalent, the business mandates are then delegated to the relevant Head of business. These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Local Head of Global Markets as appropriate.  Latam Once the limits have been approved by Group Risk WMR and Local RMCs, but subject to RMM ratification, the Entity mandates are delegated to the Country CEO, who in turn delegates to Local Head of Global Markets.  These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Local Heads of Global Markets as appropriate.    D.20.2.4 REVIEW OF LIMITS \\x96 LIMIT CHANGE PROCESS Introduction In some cases limit breaches may trigger the requirement for a temporary limit increase to be applied for a specified period or a permanent limit increase application may be submitted. Back dating of temporary or permanent limit changes is strictly forbidden. Any changes required should be applied in accordance with Markets FIM requirements. For the definition of Major/Minor Limits see Appendix D.20.2.1.  The procedures for Permanent Limit Applications are the same as the relevant Temporary Limit Applications below but with the with the additional requirements of updating the mandate, amending limit reports accordingly and circulating revised mandates to relevant Business Line Managers/Group Risk WMR where applicable.  Registers containing details of all temporary and permanent limit changes are required to be maintained. For temporary limit changes, follow up action is required when approaching the expiry date. This may involve rolling for a further period or closing out.   Region / Entity Level Limits Temporary Limit Application - These are at the level that are submitted to Group WMR as part of the Annual Limit review and hence for some regions are at the consolidated level for Global Markets and not the entity level. These regions include HBEU, HBAP HBME. \\x96 Where a limit increase is required, the business must prepare business rationale to support application in order to obtain written approval from Regional FO Senior Management, Global/Regional Head of Traded Risk and the Regional CRO as appropriate. \\x96 Submit temporary limit request in the format of the agreed template in section D.20.2.4.1, together with business rationale to Group Risk WMR for approval. \\x96 Where limit is subject to RMC approval, retrospective approval/advice should be sought (at monthly meeting).  In the meantime, Group Risk WMR approval must be obtained (with WMR reference provided). \\x96 Advise MRC for risk monitoring and the designated individual at the Group / Regional level for record keeping. \\x96 MRC must be informed throughout the approval process using the relevant regional mailbox detailed below.  Other Limits Temporary Limit Application - Where limit requirement exceeds/threatens Entity level limit, procedures for Entity requirements should be adhered simultaneously. - (For Major Limits) Where a limit increase is required, the business must prepare business rationale to support application in order to obtain written approval from Regional FO Senior Management and Regional Head of Traded Risk. The temporary limit increase application must be submitted in the format of the agreed template in section D.20.2.4.1 and be escalated, reviewed and approved at least one management level higher than the BAU owner responsible. - (For Volcker limits for definition see D20.2.1), the trading desk must submit the request in the format of the agreed template in section D.20.2.4.1 including demonstrable analysis to support the request for the temporary or permanent increase. Regional Traded Risk must review and test this analysis and document its rationale for approving the limit request. The Traded Risk lead has the authority to independently approve a limit increase of up to 10% of the current limit level. If the limit increase is greater than 10% of the current limit, then the limit change requires the additional approval from the Regional Head of Traded Risk. - (For Minor Limits) Utilisation of limit by asset class should be checked with relevant Traded Risk lead. The Traded Risk lead has the authority to independently approve a limit increase of up to 10% of the current limit level. If the limit increase is greater than 10% of the current limit, the limit change requires the additional approval from Regional Head of Traded Risk. - Document request and (for Major Limits only) copy Group Risk WMR (using GMO TMR mailbox). - Advise Traded Risk Control for risk monitoring and the designated individual at the Group / Regional level for record keeping.  - All documentation (trading desk analysis, Traded Risk testing of trading desk analysis, Traded Risk rationale for approval of limit change, communication of limit approval) must be stored in a secure location that is compliant with record retention policies.

Region / Entity Level Limit Excesses - These should only arise in exceptional circumstances. - An email report using the Limit Breach Escalation template in Markets FIM Appendix D.20.3.4.1 should be sent to the Regional & Global Head of Global Markets, the Regional & Global COO of Global Markets, the Regional & Global Head of Traded Risk, Group Risk WMR and the Trade Control Function informing them of the excess on the same business day. - This email report should be stored in a secure location that is compliant with record retention policies. - BRCM should be copied on these emails and will sample test that all Major limit excesses have evidence of appropriate escalation. - These excesses are reported individually in the monthly RMC pack.  Other Major Limit Excesses - All excesses at this level must be escalated to local management (see FIM B.20.3.2). - An email report using the Limit Breach Escalation template in Markets FIM Appendix D.20.3.4.1 should be sent to the Local & Regional Head of Global Markets, the Regional COO of Global Markets, the Regional Head of Traded Risk, Group Risk WMR, the Trade Control Function informing them of the excess, the desk involved, and the named mandate owner. - This email report should be stored in a secure location that is compliant with record retention policies. - BRCM should be copied on these emails and will sample test that all Major limit excesses have evidence of appropriate escalation. - Formal escalation to regional management should occur within a week of the exception being verified as a genuine excess. - For \\x91Volcker\\x92 limits, excesses need to be investigated for the presence of proprietary trading and are reported to the Business Line Volcker Risk Committee and, only in the instances where evidence of proprietary trading has been identified, the Regional RMC.  Major Limits \\x96 Referrals - These should be escalated in the same manner as for the appropriate level Major Limit excess with the exception of escalation to BRCM and, where applicable, the Volcker Risk Committee and Regional RMC.  - Where the rationale for the limit breach is shown in the Limit Breach Escalation template, it may indicate that the excess is to be kept (with details of conditions for keeping the referral limit excess).   Desk Level Stop-Loss Excesses - Excesses to daily, monthly or YTD Stop Loss Limits at a Desk level must be advised to the Head of Desk, Head of Front Office, Regional Head of Traded Risk and Group Risk WMR on the following business day in the Limit Breach Escalation template set out in Markets FIM Appendix D.20.3.4.1. - Evidence of follow up actions is required.  Desk Excesses on Minor Limits - All minor excesses should be reported at a minimum to the management layer 1 level up from the person responsible for signing off the risk report. This should be done on a T 1 basis. - Material breaches of minor limits should be escalated as per Major Limits. - The Regional Head of Global Markets, the Regional COO of Global Markets, the Regional Head of Traded Risk and the Trade Control Function must be notified of the number of excesses on Minor limits. - At a minimum, this notification should consist of a monthly report showing the number of excesses per mandate. This report should include both major and minor excesses. - This notification should also form part of the monthly RMC submission. - Where local regulations or policy oblige more detailed or timely escalation to occur, these local regulations must be followed.   Threshold Excesses - These are for the Traded Risk Manager\\x92s information only, however a large number of threshold breaches may still warrant escalation at the Traded Risk manager\\x92s discretion, particularly if the number is outside the normal levels of other desks or has increased over time.  Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) - Red and Amber thresholds should be set by Traded Risk for major and minor limit excesses per month for each business at a regional level. The number of excesses should be monitored against these thresholds in order to gauge behaviour against acceptable bounds of operational risk. - If Threshold limits are used, RAG thresholds should be set on excesses on these as well. - The results should be included in the relevant BCC packs and amber or red breaches should be escalated via the business BCCs. - Red and Amber thresholds should also be set at a site level to monitor the total number of excesses across all desks. The results should be monitored via the monthly regional Traded Risk BCC meeting or equivalent. Further escalation required should be to the relevant RMC.

delegated to the Heads of Global Markets however a portion of some or all of the limits may be withheld to allow flexibility for unusual market opportunities For further detail as to how the process works in each region see Appendix D2023    B2024 Interim Amendment of Limits Policy Interim amendment of limits requires the approval of Group Risk WMR  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To ensure senior management support completion of due diligence where appropriate and Group Risk WMR approval of limit amendments  Application These will occur from time to time\\xa0It is expected that businesses will endeavour to anticipate their immediate and future market risk limit requirements when submitting limits for annual review However the need for interim amendments may arise but these can only be utilised after formal approval or recommendation for approval has been obtained from\\xa0Group Risk WMR\\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0 All requests for limits should have the support of senior management of the site andor the region and requests must be able to be independently monitored and have been through an appropriate due diligence as necessary \\xa0 Oneoff transaction proposals which require limit amendments may be submitted but must also have been through a sufficient due diligence process and carry senior management support prior to submission to\\xa0Group Risk WMR  See Appendix D2024 for detailed description of the Limit Change Process     B2025 Exceptional Review Policy In exceptional circumstances Group Risk WMR may give instruction for limits to be reduced  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To retain risk within the Groups appetite  Application Group Risk WMR may give instruction to reduce any position or limit in exceptional circumstances    B2031 Compliance with Market Risk Limits Policy The Head of Front Office of each unit is responsible for ensuring that limits are complied with  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To define responsibility and accountability  Application The Head of Front Office of each unit is responsible for ensuring that limits are complied with    B2032 Monitoring of Market Risk Limits Policy Utilisation against overnight limits will be independently monitored on a daily basis  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To ensure risk positions are managed within approved limits  Application Utilisation against overnight limits will be monitored by an independent limits monitoring team on a daily basis\\xa0All new or amended limits should be monitored from the date of\\xa0Group Risk WMR  local approval Limits must be promptly loaded to the appropriate limit monitoring system  \\xa0 If any\\xa0sublimits of the\\xa0Group Risk WMR limits are set locally by Traded Risk then they\\xa0should also be independently monitored on a daily basis Excesses at this level should only be reported to local management  Utilisation of intraday limits cannot be verified independently since reported utilisation depends upon the speed and order of input to computer systems The responsibility for complying with limits intraday rests with the Desk Head and the ultimate responsibility with the Head of Front Office Where system constraints exist it is understood that intraday risk limits cannot be monitored However front office personnel and Traded Risk management should have an understanding of the effect that new trades will have on risks and consider the impact of new positions in relation to any limits It is Front Office responsibility to ensure that utilisations meet end of day limits Where intraday trading  hedging activity creates the likelihood that end of day risk limits will be breached it is Front Office responsibility to inform Traded Risk management agree remedial action and date by which remediation must take place  \\xa0 To assist in the annual limit review Section B2022 a history of daily utilisations of the major limits must be kept    B2033 PreApproval of Excesses Over Market Risk Limits Policy Anticipated excesses over market risk limits require the preapproval of Group Risk WMR  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To ensure risks taken are within the Groups appetite  Application Where it is anticipated that there may be an excess over a entity mandate market risk limit approval must be sought from\\xa0Group Risk WMR by either the Head of Front Office or local Traded Risk manager in terms of either a temporary or permanent limit extension note Group Risk WMR approval is not required for desk level limits \\xa0 Details of the size of the excess potential duration and reason for the excess will be required before approval is recommended    B2034 Excesses Over Market Risk Limits Policy Excesses must be explained by the Head of Front Office to the Principal Office Manager and Group Risk WMR notified on the same business day  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To monitor and escalate as necessary excesses over approved limits  Application These should only arise in exceptional circumstances  \\xa0 Excesses must generally be reported to one level of management above the owner of the limit that has been breached and reported to Group Risk WMR for entity mandate excesses using the Limit Breach Escalation template in Markets FIM D20341 However for the escalation process for each level of limit breach see Appendix D2034  \\xa0 Note 1 Excesses to Stop Loss Limits at a Desk level must be advised to the Head of Desk Head of Front Office Head of Regional Traded Risk Management and Group Risk WMR on the following business day in the report format set out in Appendix D2034\\xa0 Evidence of follow up actions is required    B2035 Summary Report of Significant Limit Excesses and Limit Amendments Policy Regions should ensure that a summary of significant market risk limit excesses and market risk limit amendments together with appropriate explanations are submitted to the appropriate RMC or ALCO where RMC has not been constituted The information must be sent on a monthly basis  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To ensure senior management are aware of significant limit excesses and amendments  Application Regions should ensure that a summary of significant market risk limit excesses and market risk limit amendments together with appropriate explanations are submitted to their local RMC or local ALCO where\\xa0RMC is not constituted\\xa0for information on a monthly basis Regional subsidiary head offices should include material changes for all their sites in this submission to the regional RMC or regional ALCO where no regional RMC has not been constituted                    D2021 DEFINITION OF MAJOR LIMITS MINOR LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS All limit breaches are reportable and will be taken into account when reviewing trader behaviour and used in the year end evaluation process Traded Risk has apportioned these limits for governance and control purposes However it should not be assumed that any limit is moreless important than another one  Major Limits These are agreed regionally by each Regional Head of Traded Risk and are tailored to the specific risk profiles of the regional businesses activity Major limits generally comprise those desk limits that ensure that the overall risk at Site and Consolidated Entity level is within the risk appetite limits set by Group and Regional WMR These may include but are not limited to  Desk level Suballocations of the site level market risk limits are used to contain the risk exposures of the trading desk such that the combined activity is in accordance with the risk appetite of the bank at Site and Entity level They will include but are not limited to  Any of the metrics capped at the Group or overall Global Markets levels  Stop Losses at the Site level exceeding the limit by the lower of 50 or USD5m  The desk level permitted instrument lists  Referrals a particular type of limit set around factors which may be beyond the power of the traders to control Breaches of stoploss referrals must be escalated as per FIM B2034  Volcker Limits All desk level limits deemed to be \\x91Volcker\\x92 Limits under the various Volcker exemptions are classed as Major limits for that desk and escalated accordingly  Minor Limits Any limits not defined as Major Limits are termed Minor limits Effective risk management requires a more granular set of controls than are defined by the Major limits so when designing the mandate for each business andor desk the Traded Risk defines more refined limits around the risk factors specific to that desk These Traded Risk defined limits ensure that the risk exposure is managed at an appropriately granular level eg to enable Traded Risk managers to restrict large offsetting IR exposures at individual tenor pointsbuckets which would not be apparent from looking at the outright IR exposure They also alert Traded Risk to unusual or unexpected activity or allow Traded Risk to constrain specific activities to de minimis levels as required  Minor limits are designed to ensure that the desksite is operating within all intended parameters and are set out in each trading mandate They are typically calibrated against \\x93Business as Usual\\x94 activity   From a desk perspective both Major and Minor limits must be treated in accordance with FIM C115 with Traded Risk requiring to be informed prior to any situation that could lead to an excess and a temporary increase agreed in advance  Thresholds Thresholds may be set around any risk factor that the risk manager is interested in triggering if exposure exceeds a certain level They are often set as a percentage of an existing limit or to monitor suballocations of a desk where the hard limits are set at desk level Thresholds are for information purposes only however a large number of trigger breaches may still warrant escalation if the risk manager has concerns particularly if the number is outside the normal levels of other desks or has increased over time  Review of Limit Categories The limit categories should be reviewed on an annual basis by Traded Risk and signed off by the Regional Head of Traded Risk Justification should be given for all Major Referral Minor and Threshold limits Evidence of the review should be saved as per the record retention policy   Suggested Justifications Minor limits  Limit not set at Entity or equivalent level  PortfolioStrategy Limit is monitored as Major Limit at desk level  Suggested Justifications Thresholds  PortfolioStrategy Limit is monitored as Minor Limit at desk level  Threshold set as  of mandate limit  The limit category of each limit must be clearly marked on the mandate eg by a colourcoding system This is to ensure that all parties are aware of the limit category for each limit  The limit category of each limit should also be recorded in any limit monitoring system This is to ensure that the correct escalation is applied in the event of a breach and the category should be included in any reconciliations between the system and the mandates where required    D2022 REVIEW OF LIMITS D20221 ANNUAL LIMIT REVIEW ALR The Annual Limit Review ALR is prepared by Group Risk WMR and reviewed by the Risk Management Meeting RMM of the Group Management Board GMB each year ALCO books are additionally approved by the relevant local ALCO and Group ALCM  All entity requests should be submitted to\\xa0Group Risk WMR in writing Requests should clearly indicate the support of the relevant CEO Principal Office Manager or delegate and where applicable the local andor regional Head of Global Markets or equivalent and the regional Head of Traded Risk All annual submissions must contain without exception formal confirmation that all limits can be independently monitored and that all products have passed through an appropriate due diligence process    The level of market risk limits set for each operation depends upon the size and financial and capital resources of the business the business plan calibration for customer demand ie RENTD calibration under Volcker the market liquidity the experience and track record of the management and dealers Internal Audit grading from Group Financial Services Audit support function resources and computer systems  The Traded Risk management units within the regions are responsible for coordinating the submission of market and credit risk limit proposals on behalf of all Global Markets operations Limit applications are submitted in accordance with Markets FIM Section B20 and B30 unless otherwise agreed with Group Risk WMR Where the scope of limits required varies from that in place for the previous year Group Risk WMR will advise under separate cover Dispensations from the requirement to set limits should be formally requested as part of the Markets FIM dispensation process via the Group Manuals System  Traded Risk are required to explicitly confirm the all the limits proposed in the submissions are independently monitored daily on an endofday basis or as appropriate in accordance with Markets FIM and that due diligence has been completed for all permitted products  As part of the scope for the review and for ongoing interim limit amendments where branches or subsidiaries are covered within a major entity mandate any legal regulatory or local procedural requirements should be considered in addition to any capital implications when allocating limits to or from the sites within that major entity mandate  It is a mandatory requirement for all submissions to incorporate a comprehensive strategy paper using the Group Risk WMR approved template for each Volcker trading desk  This should be submitted as part of the supporting documentation together with a copy of the AOP and any further market data information that may assist with the approval process for the existing limit structure and any new business initiative  The paper should incorporate any information as appropriate to the business requirements  Limit recommendations will not be approved without a comprehensive strategy paper   Approval Process  Timetable set by Group Risk WMR  Regional Traded Risk sends requests to sites for submissions  Requests should clearly indicate the necessity for confirmation of support from the relevant CEO CFO and Principal Office Manager or delegate together with utilisation figures audit results and AOP    Regional Traded Risk complete reviews usually by early October including documenting rationale for changes  Obtain support from regional Head of Global Markets for all Entities  Initial discussions held with Group Risk WMR  Entity level proposals are submitted to Group Risk WMR usually at end of October  Following Group Risk WMR approval submit a copy of entity limits for approval to regional GBM Traded Risk RMC  Once recommended for approval by Group Risk WMR limits will be subject to ratification of the RMM normally in February each year  The procedures relating to the delegation of risk limits are documented in the Markets FIM Section 2023  Essentially once limits have been approved subject to RMM ratification of the Groupentity limits the regional entity mandate is delegated to the regional Treasurer  Further delegation of the sitebranch mandates is issued to the Branch Treasury Manager by the regional Head of Global Markets and copied to the local CEO  These limits are in turn passed onto the Desk Managers by the regional Treasurer and Branch Treasury Manager    Regional Traded Risk administers the process of issuingrenewing all trading authorities on an annual basis   Trading Desks  Regional Traded review and discuss limit requirements with Head of Desk  Head of the Desk prepares and submits the strategy paper  All limit changes as proposed by asset class Traded Risk or recommended by the head of  the business line should be discussed with the Traded Risk lead for the relevant asset class  Meetings held with asset class Traded Risk lead and regional Head of Traded Risk for approval  All recommendations consolidated into regional mandate  Utilisation at regional entity level obtained from Traded Risk Control for high levelsummary asset class limits   D20222 QUARTERLY LIMIT REVIEW At the end of each quarter there is a review of limit utilisations and where these are low in consultation with the business regional Traded Risk should suggest reductions to Group Risk WMR It is also expected that desks will recalibrate their RENTD calculations quarterly where appropriate and hence there may be a need to recalibrate the desk Volcker limits quarterly as well Note desks will need to document the rationale for any changes to limits and Traded Risk will be required to review these rationales The approvals for these limit changes should be in line with the standard procedure for any limit change   D20223 REVIEW OF DESK STRATEGY PAPERS Traded Risk are required to complete certain sections of the Desk Strategy Papers that relate to the market risk limits currently sections 331 41 44 of v15 of the Market Making strategy template and also to review those sections that relate to the trading and hedging strategies employed by the desk as well as those relating to the desk limits This review is required as a minimum of annually when the Annual Limit Review is completed and when updates are made to the Desk Strategy Papers this includes where the updates to any section are made  The Desk Strategy Paper includes the desk limit mandate and the permitted instrument list and for Desks using the RMH exemption under Volcker  Both of these are subject to the Annual Limit Review  It should be noted that desks that make use of the Trading on Behalf of Customers \\x91ToBoC\\x92 the permitted instrument lists cannot contain derivative instruments  There needs to be control over the review process including documentation of who and when each review was undertaken   D20224 PERMITTED INSTRUMENT LISTS The Desk Strategy Paper includes the limit mandate which also includes the permitted instrument list This needs to be reviewed annually as well Permitted instruments are only allowed to be added to a desks permitted instrument list once the instrument has passed through the appropriate due diligence process  It should be noted that for desks that make use of the Trading on Behalf of Customers \\x91ToBoC\\x92 exemption under Volcker the permitted instrument lists cannot contain derivative instruments  Any breach of the Permitted Instrument lists is deemed to be a Major limit breach and escalated as per D2034 This includes restrictions on an instrument such as a tenor breach    D2023 Delegation of Limits by Region Europe  Middle East The procedures relating to the delegation of risk limits are documented in the Markets FIM Section 2023  Essentially once the limits have been approved by Group Risk WMR and the regional RMC subject to RMM ratification of the GroupEntity limits the regional entity mandates are delegated to the Regional Head of Global Markets  Further delegation of the sitebranch level mandates are issued to the Local Head of Global Markets by the Regional Head of Global Markets and copied to the local CEO  These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Local Head of Global Markets as appropriate  Asia Once the limits have been approved by HBAP RMC they go to the regional CEO of HBAP and CEO for Hong Kong for further delegation These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Regional Head of Global Markets as appropriate  North America Once the entity limits have been approved by the regional RMC or equivalent the business mandates are then delegated to the relevant Head of business These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Local Head of Global Markets as appropriate  Latam Once the limits have been approved by Group Risk WMR and Local RMCs but subject to RMM ratification the Entity mandates are delegated to the Country CEO who in turn delegates to Local Head of Global Markets  These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Local Heads of Global Markets as appropriate    D2024 REVIEW OF LIMITS \\x96 LIMIT CHANGE PROCESS Introduction In some cases limit breaches may trigger the requirement for a temporary limit increase to be applied for a specified period or a permanent limit increase application may be submitted Back dating of temporary or permanent limit changes is strictly forbidden Any changes required should be applied in accordance with Markets FIM requirements For the definition of MajorMinor Limits see Appendix D2021  The procedures for Permanent Limit Applications are the same as the relevant Temporary Limit Applications below but with the with the additional requirements of updating the mandate amending limit reports accordingly and circulating revised mandates to relevant Business Line ManagersGroup Risk WMR where applicable  Registers containing details of all temporary and permanent limit changes are required to be maintained For temporary limit changes follow up action is required when approaching the expiry date This may involve rolling for a further period or closing out   Region  Entity Level Limits Temporary Limit Application  These are at the level that are submitted to Group WMR as part of the Annual Limit review and hence for some regions are at the consolidated level for Global Markets and not the entity level These regions include HBEU HBAP HBME \\x96 Where a limit increase is required the business must prepare business rationale to support application in order to obtain written approval from Regional FO Senior Management GlobalRegional Head of Traded Risk and the Regional CRO as appropriate \\x96 Submit temporary limit request in the format of the agreed template in section D20241 together with business rationale to Group Risk WMR for approval \\x96 Where limit is subject to RMC approval retrospective approvaladvice should be sought at monthly meeting  In the meantime Group Risk WMR approval must be obtained with WMR reference provided \\x96 Advise MRC for risk monitoring and the designated individual at the Group  Regional level for record keeping \\x96 MRC must be informed throughout the approval process using the relevant regional mailbox detailed below  Other Limits Temporary Limit Application  Where limit requirement exceedsthreatens Entity level limit procedures for Entity requirements should be adhered simultaneously  For Major Limits Where a limit increase is required the business must prepare business rationale to support application in order to obtain written approval from Regional FO Senior Management and Regional Head of Traded Risk The temporary limit increase application must be submitted in the format of the agreed template in section D20241 and be escalated reviewed and approved at least one management level higher than the BAU owner responsible  For Volcker limits for definition see D2021 the trading desk must submit the request in the format of the agreed template in section D20241 including demonstrable analysis to support the request for the temporary or permanent increase Regional Traded Risk must review and test this analysis and document its rationale for approving the limit request The Traded Risk lead has the authority to independently approve a limit increase of up to 10 of the current limit level If the limit increase is greater than 10 of the current limit then the limit change requires the additional approval from the Regional Head of Traded Risk  For Minor Limits Utilisation of limit by asset class should be checked with relevant Traded Risk lead The Traded Risk lead has the authority to independently approve a limit increase of up to 10 of the current limit level If the limit increase is greater than 10 of the current limit the limit change requires the additional approval from Regional Head of Traded Risk  Document request and for Major Limits only copy Group Risk WMR using GMO TMR

Limits  All minor excesses should be reported at a minimum to the management layer 1 level up from the person responsible for signing off the risk report This should be done on a T 1 basis  Material breaches of minor limits should be escalated as per Major Limits  The Regional Head of Global Markets the Regional COO of Global Markets the Regional Head of Traded Risk and the Trade Control Function must be notified of the number of excesses on Minor limits  At a minimum this notification should consist of a monthly report showing the number of excesses per mandate This report should include both major and minor excesses  This notification should also form part of the monthly RMC submission  Where local regulations or policy oblige more detailed or timely escalation to occur these local regulations must be followed   Threshold Excesses  These are for the Traded Risk Manager\\x92s information only however a large number of threshold breaches may still warrant escalation at the Traded Risk manager\\x92s discretion particularly if the number is outside the normal levels of other desks or has increased over time  Key Risk Indicators KRIs  Red and Amber thresholds should be set by Traded Risk for major and minor limit excesses per month for each business at a regional level The number of excesses should be monitored against these thresholds in order to gauge behaviour against acceptable bounds of operational risk  If Threshold limits are used RAG thresholds should be set on excesses on these as well  The results should be included in the relevant BCC packs and amber or red breaches should be escalated via the business BCCs  Red and Amber thresholds should also be set at a site level to monitor the total number of excesses across all desks The results should be monitored

limits  Application The level of market risk limits set for each operation depends upon the size and financial and capital resources of the business the business plan the experience and track record of the management and dealers internal audit gradings from Group Financial Services Audit GHQ AUF support function resources and computer systems  Market Risk limits should be sufficiently granular and of a level to ensure that large and significant concentrations to sectors risk factors and counterparties are not allowed to build up that could threaten the ongoing operations of HSBC Group  Throughout Section B limits refers to the limit mandate which where applicable also includes the permitted instrument list  See Appendix D for definition of Major Limits Minor Limits and Thresholds   B Review of Group Limits Policy Market risk limits must be reviewed annually  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To establish formal market risk limits annually for each site within Group caps  Application The Annual Limit Review ALR will be prepared by Group Risk WMR and reviewed by the Risk Management Meeting RMM of the Group Management Board GMB each year  \\xa0 Each site should submit a request annually to apply for market risk limits covering the following calendar year All requests should be submitted to\\xa0Group Risk WMR in writing Requests should clearly indicate the support of the relevant CEO Principal Office Manager or delegate and where applicable the local andor regional Head of Global Markets and the Regional Head of Traded Risk All annual submissions must contain without exception formal confirmation that all limits can be independently monitored and that all products have passed through an appropriate due diligence process  \\xa0 The RMM have delegated limit approval authority to\\xa0Group Risk WMR up to preagreed Group caps These caps are reviewed annually by the RMM as part of the ALR\\xa0 \\xa0 Group Risk WMR submits material interim limit additions amendments and excesses to RMM each month  See Appendix D for details of the Annual Limit Review    B Delegation of Limits Policy Limits must be formally delegated  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To ensure senior management approval and delegated accountability  Application The Chief Executive Officer CEO or management equivalent of each Group company or division will seek the approval of the relevant Board or equivalent as appropriate Once these have been approved by Group Risk WMR and the regional RMC subject to RMM ratification the regional entity mandates are delegated to the Regional Heads of Global Markets Further delegation is done until at least Desk level mandates \\xa0 It is expected that the bulk of the limits will be delegated to the Heads of Global Markets however a portion of some or all of the limits may be withheld to allow flexibility for unusual market opportunities For further detail as to how the process works in each region see Appendix D    B Interim Amendment of Limits Policy Interim amendment of limits requires the approval of Group Risk WMR  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To ensure senior management support completion of due diligence where appropriate and Group Risk WMR approval of limit amendments  Application These will occur from time to time\\xa0It is expected that businesses will endeavour to anticipate their immediate and future market risk limit requirements when submitting limits for annual review However the need for interim amendments may arise but these can only be utilised after formal approval or recommendation for approval has been obtained from\\xa0Group Risk WMR\\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0 All requests for limits should have the support of senior management of the site andor the

Head of Front Office of each unit is responsible for ensuring that limits are complied with  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To define responsibility and accountability  Application The Head of Front Office of each unit is responsible for ensuring that limits are complied with    B Monitoring of Market Risk Limits Policy Utilisation against overnight limits will be independently monitored on a daily basis  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To ensure risk positions are managed within approved limits  Application Utilisation against overnight limits will be monitored by an independent limits monitoring team on a daily basis\\xa0All new or amended limits should be monitored from the date of\\xa0Group Risk WMR  local approval Limits must be promptly loaded to the appropriate limit monitoring system  \\xa0 If any\\xa0sublimits of the\\xa0Group Risk WMR limits are set locally by Traded Risk then they\\xa0should also be independently monitored on a daily basis Excesses at this level should only be reported to local management  Utilisation of intraday limits cannot be verified independently since reported utilisation depends upon the speed and order of input to computer systems The responsibility for complying with limits intraday rests with the Desk Head and the ultimate responsibility with the Head of Front Office Where system constraints exist it is understood that intraday risk limits cannot be monitored However front office personnel and Traded Risk management should have an understanding of the effect that new trades will have on risks and consider the impact of new positions in relation to any limits It is Front Office responsibility to ensure that utilisations meet end of day limits Where intraday trading  hedging activity creates the likelihood that end of day risk limits will be breached it is Front Office responsibility to inform Traded Risk management agree remedial action and date by which remediation must take place  \\xa0 To assist in the annual limit review Section B a history of daily utilisations of the major limits must be kept    B PreApproval of Excesses Over Market Risk Limits Policy Anticipated excesses over market risk limits require the preapproval of Group Risk WMR  Risk Type Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To ensure risks taken are within the Groups appetite  Application Where it is anticipated that there may be an excess over a entity mandate market risk limit approval must be sought from\\xa0Group Risk WMR by either the Head of Front Office or local Traded Risk manager in terms of either a

Primary Market  Secondary  Purpose To ensure senior management are aware of significant limit excesses and amendments  Application Regions should ensure that a summary of significant market risk limit excesses and market risk limit amendments together with appropriate explanations are submitted to their local RMC or local ALCO where\\xa0RMC is not constituted\\xa0for information on a monthly basis Regional subsidiary head offices should include material changes for all their sites in this submission to the regional RMC or regional ALCO where no regional RMC has not been constituted                    D DEFINITION OF MAJOR LIMITS MINOR LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS All limit breaches are reportable and will be taken into account when reviewing trader behaviour and used in the year end evaluation process Traded Risk has apportioned these limits for governance and control purposes However it should not be assumed that any limit is moreless important than another one  Major Limits These are agreed regionally by each Regional Head of Traded Risk and are tailored to the specific risk profiles of the regional businesses activity Major limits generally comprise those desk limits that ensure that the overall risk at Site and Consolidated Entity level is within the risk appetite limits set by Group and Regional WMR These may include but are not limited to  Desk level Suballocations of the site level market risk limits are used to contain the risk exposures of the trading desk such that the combined activity is in accordance with the risk appetite of the bank at Site and Entity level They will include but are not limited to  Any of the metrics capped at the Group or overall Global Markets levels  Stop Losses at the Site level exceeding the limit by the lower of  or USDm  The desk level permitted instrument lists  Referrals a particular type of limit set around factors which may be beyond the power of the traders to control Breaches of stoploss referrals must be escalated as per FIM B  Volcker Limits All desk level limits deemed to be \\x91Volcker\\x92 Limits under the various Volcker exemptions are classed as Major limits for that desk and escalated accordingly  Minor Limits Any limits not defined as Major Limits are termed Minor limits Effective risk management requires a more granular set of controls than are defined by the Major limits so when designing the mandate for each business andor desk the Traded Risk defines more refined limits around the risk factors specific to that desk These Traded Risk defined limits ensure that the risk exposure is managed at an appropriately granular level eg to enable Traded Risk managers to restrict large offsetting IR exposures at individual tenor pointsbuckets which would not be apparent from looking at the outright IR exposure They also alert Traded Risk to unusual or unexpected activity or allow Traded Risk to constrain specific activities to de minimis levels as required  Minor limits are designed to ensure that the desksite is operating within all intended parameters and are set out in each trading mandate They are typically calibrated against \\x93Business as Usual\\x94 activity   From a desk perspective both Major and Minor limits must be treated in accordance with FIM C with Traded Risk requiring to be informed prior to any situation that could lead to an excess and a temporary increase agreed in advance  Thresholds Thresholds may be set around any risk factor that the risk manager is interested in triggering if exposure exceeds a certain level They are often set as a percentage of an existing limit or to monitor suballocations of a desk where the hard limits are set at desk level Thresholds are for information purposes only however a large number of trigger breaches may still warrant escalation if the risk manager has concerns particularly if the number is outside the normal levels of other desks or has increased over time  Review of Limit Categories The limit categories should be reviewed on an annual basis by Traded Risk and signed off by the Regional Head of Traded Risk Justification should be given for all Major Referral Minor and Threshold limits Evidence of the review should be saved as per the record retention policy   Suggested Justifications Minor limits  Limit not set at Entity or equivalent level  PortfolioStrategy Limit is monitored as Major Limit at desk level  Suggested Justifications Thresholds  PortfolioStrategy Limit is monitored as Minor Limit at desk level  Threshold set as  of mandate limit  The limit category of each limit must be clearly marked on the mandate eg by a colourcoding system This is to ensure that all parties are aware of the limit category for each limit  The limit category of each limit should also be recorded in any limit monitoring system This is to ensure that the correct escalation is applied in the event of a breach and the category should be included in any reconciliations between the system and the mandates where required    D REVIEW OF LIMITS D ANNUAL LIMIT REVIEW ALR The Annual Limit Review ALR is prepared by Group Risk WMR and reviewed by the Risk Management Meeting RMM of the Group Management Board GMB each year ALCO books are additionally approved by the relevant local ALCO and Group ALCM  All entity requests should be submitted to\\xa0Group Risk WMR in writing Requests should clearly indicate the support of the relevant CEO Principal Office Manager or delegate and where applicable the local andor regional Head of Global Markets or equivalent and the regional Head of Traded Risk All annual submissions must contain without exception formal confirmation that all limits can be independently monitored and that all products have passed through an appropriate due diligence process    The level of market risk limits set for each operation depends upon the size and financial and capital resources of the business the business plan calibration for customer demand ie RENTD calibration under Volcker the market liquidity the experience and track record of the management and dealers Internal Audit grading from Group Financial Services Audit support function resources and computer systems  The Traded Risk management units within the regions are responsible for coordinating the submission of market and credit risk limit proposals on behalf of all Global Markets operations Limit applications are submitted in accordance with Markets FIM Section B and B unless otherwise agreed with Group Risk WMR Where the scope of limits required varies from that in place for the previous year Group Risk WMR will advise under separate cover Dispensations from the requirement to set limits should be formally requested as part of the Markets FIM dispensation process via the Group Manuals System  Traded Risk are required to explicitly confirm the all the limits proposed in the submissions are independently monitored daily on an endofday basis or as appropriate in accordance with Markets FIM and that due diligence has been completed for all permitted products  As part of the scope for the review and for ongoing interim limit amendments where branches or subsidiaries are covered within a major entity mandate any legal regulatory or local procedural requirements should be considered in addition to any capital implications when allocating limits to or from the sites within that major entity mandate  It is a mandatory requirement for all submissions to incorporate a comprehensive strategy paper using the Group Risk WMR approved template for each Volcker trading desk  This should be submitted as part of the supporting documentation together with a copy of the AOP and any further market data information that may assist with the approval process for the existing limit structure and any new business initiative  The paper should incorporate any information as appropriate to the business requirements  Limit recommendations will not be approved without a comprehensive strategy paper   Approval Process  Timetable set by Group Risk WMR  Regional Traded Risk sends requests to sites for submissions  Requests should clearly indicate the necessity for confirmation of support from the relevant CEO CFO and Principal Office Manager or delegate together with utilisation figures audit results and AOP    Regional Traded Risk complete reviews usually by early October including documenting rationale for changes  Obtain support from regional Head of Global Markets for all Entities  Initial discussions held with Group Risk WMR  Entity level proposals are submitted to Group Risk WMR usually at end of October  Following Group Risk WMR approval submit a copy of entity limits for approval to regional GBM Traded Risk RMC  Once recommended for approval by Group Risk WMR limits will be subject to ratification of the RMM normally in February each year  The procedures relating to the delegation of risk limits are documented in the Markets FIM Section   Essentially once limits have been approved subject to RMM ratification of the Groupentity limits the regional entity mandate is delegated to the regional Treasurer  Further delegation of the sitebranch mandates is issued to the Branch Treasury Manager by the regional Head of Global Markets and copied to the local CEO  These limits are in turn passed onto the Desk Managers by the regional Treasurer and Branch Treasury Manager    Regional Traded Risk administers the process of issuingrenewing all trading authorities on an annual basis   Trading Desks  Regional Traded review and discuss limit requirements with Head of Desk  Head of the Desk prepares and submits the strategy paper  All limit changes as proposed by asset class Traded Risk or recommended by the head of  the business line should be discussed with the Traded Risk lead for the relevant asset class  Meetings held with asset class Traded Risk lead and regional Head of Traded Risk for approval  All recommendations consolidated into regional mandate  Utilisation at regional entity level obtained from Traded Risk Control for high levelsummary asset class limits   D QUARTERLY LIMIT REVIEW At the end of each quarter there is a review of limit utilisations and where these are low in consultation with the business regional Traded Risk should suggest reductions to Group Risk WMR It is also expected that desks will recalibrate their RENTD calculations quarterly where appropriate and hence there may be a need to recalibrate the desk Volcker limits quarterly as well Note desks will need to document the rationale for any changes to limits and Traded Risk will be required to review these rationales The approvals for these limit changes should be in line with the standard procedure for any limit change   D REVIEW OF DESK STRATEGY PAPERS Traded Risk are required to complete certain sections of the Desk Strategy Papers that relate to the market risk limits currently sections    of v of the Market Making strategy template and also to review those sections that relate to the trading and hedging strategies employed by the desk as well as those relating to the desk limits This review is required as a minimum of annually when the Annual Limit Review is completed and when updates are made to the Desk Strategy Papers this includes where the updates to any section are made  The Desk Strategy Paper includes the desk limit mandate and the permitted instrument list and for Desks using the RMH exemption under Volcker  Both of these are subject to the Annual Limit Review  It should be noted that desks that make use of the Trading on Behalf of Customers \\x91ToBoC\\x92 the permitted instrument lists cannot contain derivative instruments  There needs to be control over the review process including documentation of who and when each review was undertaken   D PERMITTED INSTRUMENT LISTS The Desk Strategy Paper includes the limit mandate which also includes the permitted instrument list This needs to be reviewed annually as well Permitted instruments are only allowed to be added to a desks permitted instrument list once the instrument has passed through the appropriate due diligence process  It should be noted that for desks that make use of the Trading on Behalf of Customers \\x91ToBoC\\x92 exemption under Volcker the permitted instrument lists cannot contain derivative instruments  Any breach of the Permitted Instrument lists is deemed to be a Major limit breach and escalated as per D This includes restrictions on an instrument such as a tenor breach    D Delegation of Limits by Region Europe  Middle East The procedures relating to the delegation of risk limits are documented in the Markets FIM Section   Essentially once the limits have been approved by Group Risk WMR and the regional RMC subject to RMM ratification of the GroupEntity limits the regional entity mandates are delegated to the Regional Head of Global Markets  Further delegation of the sitebranch level mandates are issued to the Local Head of Global Markets by the Regional Head of Global Markets and copied to the local CEO  These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Local Head of Global Markets as appropriate  Asia Once the limits have been approved by HBAP RMC they go to the regional CEO of HBAP and CEO for Hong Kong for further delegation These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Regional Head of Global Markets as appropriate  North America Once the entity limits have been approved by the regional RMC or equivalent the business mandates are then delegated to the relevant Head of business These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Local Head of Global Markets as appropriate  Latam Once the limits have been approved by Group Risk WMR and Local RMCs but subject to RMM ratification the Entity mandates are delegated to the Country CEO who in turn delegates to Local Head of Global Markets  These limits are in turn passed onto the Heads of Trading Desks by the Local Heads of Global Markets as appropriate    D REVIEW OF LIMITS \\x96 LIMIT CHANGE PROCESS Introduction In some cases limit breaches may trigger the requirement for a temporary limit increase to be applied for a specified period or a permanent limit increase application may be submitted Back dating of temporary or permanent limit changes is strictly forbidden Any changes required should be applied in accordance with Markets FIM requirements For the definition of MajorMinor Limits see Appendix D  The procedures for Permanent Limit Applications are the same as the relevant Temporary Limit Applications below but with the with the additional requirements of updating the mandate amending limit reports accordingly and circulating revised mandates to relevant Business Line ManagersGroup Risk WMR where applicable  Registers containing details of all temporary and permanent limit changes are required to be maintained For temporary limit changes follow up action is required when approaching the expiry date This may involve rolling for a further period or closing out   Region  Entity Level Limits Temporary Limit Application  These are at the level that are submitted to Group WMR as part of the Annual Limit review and hence for some regions are at the consolidated level for Global Markets and not the entity level These regions include HBEU HBAP HBME \\x96 Where a limit increase is required the business must prepare business rationale to support application in order to obtain written approval from Regional FO Senior Management GlobalRegional Head of Traded Risk and the Regional CRO as appropriate \\x96 Submit temporary limit request in the format of the agreed template in section D together with business rationale to Group Risk WMR for approval \\x96 Where limit is subject to RMC approval retrospective approvaladvice should be sought at monthly meeting  In the meantime Group Risk WMR approval must be obtained with WMR reference provided \\x96 Advise MRC for risk monitoring and the designated individual at the Group  Regional level for record keeping \\x96 MRC must be informed throughout the approval process using the relevant regional mailbox detailed below  Other Limits Temporary Limit Application  Where limit requirement exceedsthreatens Entity level limit procedures for Entity requirements should be adhered simultaneously  For Major Limits Where a limit increase is required the business must prepare business rationale to support application in order to obtain written approval from Regional FO Senior Management and Regional Head of Traded Risk The temporary limit increase application must be submitted in the format of the agreed template in section D and be escalated reviewed and approved at least one management level higher than the BAU owner responsible  For Volcker limits for definition see D the trading desk must submit the request in the format of the agreed template in section D including demonstrable analysis to support the request for the temporary or permanent increase Regional Traded Risk must review and test this analysis and document its rationale for approving the limit request The Traded Risk lead has the authority to independently approve a limit increase of up to  of the current limit level If the limit increase is greater than  of the current limit then the limit change requires the additional approval from the Regional Head of Traded Risk  For Minor Limits Utilisation of limit by asset class should be checked with relevant Traded Risk lead The Traded Risk lead has the authority to independently approve a limit increase of up to  of the current limit level If the limit increase is greater than  of the current limit the limit change requires the additional approval from Regional Head of Traded Risk  Document request and for Major Limits only copy Group Risk WMR using GMO TMR mailbox  Advise Traded

retention policies  BRCM should be copied on these emails and will sample test that all Major limit excesses have evidence of appropriate escalation  Formal escalation to regional management should occur within a week of the exception being verified as a genuine excess  For \\x91Volcker\\x92 limits excesses need to be investigated for the presence of proprietary trading and are reported to the Business Line Volcker Risk Committee and only in the instances where evidence of proprietary trading has been identified the Regional RMC  Major Limits \\x96 Referrals  These should be escalated in the same manner as for the appropriate level Major Limit excess with the exception of escalation to BRCM and where applicable the Volcker Risk Committee and Regional RMC   Where the rationale for the

at a minimum to the management layer  level up from the person responsible for signing off the risk report This should be done on a T  basis  Material breaches of minor limits should be escalated as per Major Limits  The Regional Head of Global Markets the Regional COO of Global Markets the Regional Head of Traded Risk and the Trade Control Function must be notified of the number of excesses on Minor limits  At a minimum this notification should consist of a monthly report showing the number of excesses per mandate This report should include both major and minor excesses  This notification should also form part of the monthly RMC submission  Where local regulations or policy oblige more detailed or timely escalation to occur these local regulations must be followed   Threshold Excesses  These are for the Traded Risk Manager\\x92s information only however a large number of threshold breaches may still warrant escalation at the Traded Risk manager\\x92s discretion particularly if the number is outside the normal levels of other desks or has increased over time  Key Risk Indicators KRIs  Red and Amber thresholds should be set by Traded Risk for major and minor limit excesses per month for each business at a regional level The number of excesses should be monitored against these thresholds in order to gauge behaviour against acceptable bounds of operational risk  If Threshold limits are used RAG thresholds should be set on excesses on these as well  The results should be included in the relevant BCC packs and amber or red breaches should be escalated via the business BCCs  Red and Amber thresholds should also be set at a site level to monitor the total number of excesses across all desks The results should be monitored via the monthly regional Traded Risk BCC meeting or equivalent Further escalation required should be to the relevant RMC   D LIMIT BREACH ESCALATION TEMPLATE The information below is an example of the type of information required to be completed for a
